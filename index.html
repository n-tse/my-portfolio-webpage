  <h2><em>Welcome!</em></h2>

  <p class="important">Hi there! Thanks for visiting my webpage! Before you read more into my background and the work I've done, I'd love to quickly introduce myself.</p>

  <h3 class="sectionHeader">About Me</h3>
  <p>My full name is Nicholas, but I mostly go by Nick. I'm 26 years old, and graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle in 2018 with a double major in Communication and Sociology. Currently, I'm working full-time as a Data Entry Specialist at a Biotech company in downtown Seattle, as well as part-time at Chipotle! <em>Yum.</em>
  </p>

  <p>I've always been interested in computer programming, and after feeling like I really needed to make the switch into a more promising and well-paid career, I decided to try my hand at a coding bootcamp. So far, it's definitely been <strong>quite</strong> challenging... but nothing worthwhile is ever easy, and I'm determined to do my best and become a fantastic software developer!
  </p>

  <h3>Some hobbies and interests of mine include:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Basketball (my favorite player is LeBron James. The King!!)</li>
    <li>Cooking</li>
    <li>Fishing (or more accurately, "Squidding," because I mostly catch squid."</li>
    <li>Video and Board Games</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>My favorite games to play are:</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>Genshin Impact</li>

      <li>Chess</li>
    </ol>

  <h3 class="sectionHeader">My Work</h3>  
  <h3>Here's a list of projects I've worked on during my time at Epicodus thus far.  As you may be able to tell, I still have <strong>a lot</strong> to learn.</h3>
