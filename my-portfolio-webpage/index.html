  <p>Me from 2018! Hello!</p>

  <h3>About Me</h3>
  <p>Hi there! Thanks for visiting my webpage! Before you scroll down any further, I'd love to introduce myself.</p>

  <p>My full name is Nicholas, but I mostly go by Nick. I'm 26 years old, and graduated from the University of Washington in Seattle in 2018 with a double major in Communication and Sociology. Currently, I'm working full-time as a Data Entry Specialist for a Biotech company downtown, as well as part-time at Chipotle! <em>Yum.</em>
  </p>

  <p>I've always been interested in computer programming, and after feeling like I really needed to make the switch into a more promising and well-paid career, I decided to try my hand at a coding bootcamp! So far, it's definitely been <strong>quite</strong> challenging... but nothing worthwhile is ever easy, and I'm determined to do my best and become a fantastic software developer!
  </p>

  <p>Some hobbies and interests of mine include:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Basketball (my favorite player is LeBron James. The King!!)</li>
    <li>Cooking</li>
    <li>Fishing (or more accurately, "Squidding," because I mostly catch squid.)</li>
    <li>Video and Board Games</li>
  </ul>

  <p>My favorite games to play are:
    <ol>
      <li>Genshin Impact</li>
      <li>Super Smash Bros. Ulimate</li>
      <li>Chess</li>
    </ol>
  </p>

  <p>Here's a list of projects I've worked on during my time at Epicodus so far.  As you may be able to tell, I still have <strong>a lot</strong> to learn.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/n-tse/hello-world-1.git">Hello World Project</a>, which was my first attempt at writing code.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/n-tse/goodbye.html.git">Goodbye World Project</a>: some practice with GitHub and commits.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/n-tse/cookie-recipe.git">Cookie Recipe HTML Page</a>: some practice with indentation and spacing.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/n-tse/my-first-webpage.git">My First Webpages</a>: my introductory practice with HTML and CSS</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you do take a look at any of these projects, please look through this one! I spent a lot of time reading the lessons, taking notes, and trying to understand the code. It's not perfect, but I'm still proud of what I've been able to accomplish in just a few classes!</li>
      </ul>
