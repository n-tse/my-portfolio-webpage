  <p>Me from 2018! Hello!</p>

  <p>Here's a list of projects I've worked on during my time at Epicodus so far.  As you may be able to tell, I still have <strong>a lot</strong> to learn.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/n-tse/hello-world-1.git">Hello World Project</a>, which was my first attempt at writing code.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/n-tse/goodbye.html.git">Goodbye World Project</a>: some practice with GitHub and commits.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/n-tse/cookie-recipe.git">Cookie Recipe HTML Page</a>: some practice with indentation and spacing.</li>
    <li><a href="https://github.com/n-tse/my-first-webpage.git">My First Webpages</a>: my introductory practice with HTML and CSS</li>
      <ul>
        <li>If you do take a look at any of these projects, please look through this one! I spent a lot of time reading the lessons, taking notes, and trying to understand the code. It's not perfect, but I'm still proud of what I've been able to accomplish in just a few classes!</li>
